The trophic level of a species may vary if it has a choice of diet. Virtually all plants and phytoplankton are purely phototrophic
and are at exactly level 1.0. Many worms are at around 2.1; insects 2.2; jellyfish 3.0; birds 3.6.[9] A 2013 study estimates the 
average trophic level of human beings at 2.21, similar to pigs or anchovies.[10] This is only an average, and plainly both modern 
and ancient human eating habits are complex and vary greatly. For example, a traditional Inuit living on a diet consisting primarily
of seals would have a trophic level of nearly 5.[11]
